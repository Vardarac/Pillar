'Pillar
======

Similar to the game Snake, this features a caterpillar trying to make its way in the world. Eat apples to grow bigger and faster! Higher difficulties mean a smaller arena, faster maximum speed, and the need for a higher score to win.

**Features:**
- JavaScript game logic; can be wired to other display UIs using callbacks
- CobbleView, a miniature Backbone-like, jQuery-dependent script I wrote to create and seamlessly swap collections of DOM elements
- Use of HTML, jQuery, and CSS3 to create the game display, UI transitions, and game animations

**Apps used:**
